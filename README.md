## Rock Paper Scissors
...but with a computer as opponent.  
If you've been living under a __rock__ (got it? ğŸ˜‰ğŸ˜‚) until now, here are the rules of this very old game:
* rock wins against scissors; 
* paper wins against rock; 
* and scissors wins against paper. 
* if both players throw the same hand signal, it is considered a tie, and play resumes until there is a clear winner.
